## NetSci School

The NetSci School is a two-day educational program just before the main NetSci conference. It offers intensive tutorials and hands-on workshops designed for students, early-career researchers, and newcomers to network science. Participants gain a solid foundation in state-of-the-art methods across the various network science disciplines. The school is a unique opportunity to learn from experts in the field and connect with peers in an informal, collaborative setting.



The school will take place at the room "FPN Heerlen Zaal" of the [Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Universiteitssingel+40,+6229+ER+Maastricht/@50.8358356,5.7138384,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x47c0e9838bb71633:0xf86151ae38f3c588!8m2!3d50.8358322!4d5.7164133!16s%2Fg%2F11kfbv0hys?entry=tts&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDQyMy4wIPu8ASoASAFQAw%3D%3D&skid=5a2ab926-26e3-4e0c-8b0d-a4f66d23dd9a).

                <p class="description">Dr. Huijuan Wang is an Associate Professor in the department of Intelligent Systems at Delft University of Technology.  Her research focuses on Network Data Science. She develops methodologies to model, control and predict dynamic processes  on time-evolving complex networks. Her work addresses diverse applications, ranging from viral spreading, opinion interactions,  social and financial contagion, cascades of failures to the organization of criminal activities. Dr. Wang has been a visiting  scientist in the Department of Physics at Boston University (2011-2019), as well as in the Departments of Electrical Engineering  at Stanford (2015) and Princeton (2022) Universities. She is the Co-Founder of the Dutch Network Science Society and serves  as the Chair of the Netherlands Platform for Complex Systems. In addition, she is a board member of the Network Science Society  and has been on the organizing board of the Conference on Complex Networks and its Applications since 2017.

                <p class="description">Manlio De Domenico is Associate Professor of Physics at the University of Padua, where he directs the Complex Multilayer Networks Lab.  He is also Director of the Padua Center for Network Medicine, President of the Italian Chapter of the Complex Systems Society,  co-founder and co-Director of the Mediterranean School of Complex Networks. His research explores collective phenomena in natural  and artificial interdependent systems, with significant contributions to multilayer network modeling and analysis, applying these methods  in biology, medicine, and epidemiology. His interdisciplinary work spans human mobility, disease spreading, connectomics, and network  resilience, driving advancements in systems biology, systems medicine, and computational epidemiology. He has received prestigious awards,  including the IUPAP Young Scientist Award in Statistical Physics and the German Physical Society's Young Scientist Award.  He is also a prominent science communicator, leading initiatives like *Complexity Explained* and the #ComplexityThoughts newsletter.
