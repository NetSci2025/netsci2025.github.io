<h2 id="netsci">NetSci</h2>

<p>The International School and Conference on Network Science, NetSci, is the flagship conference on Complex Networks promoted by the Network Science Society. It brings under one umbrella a wide variety of leading researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders with a direct interest in <strong>Network Science</strong>, from Physics to Computer Science, Biology, Social Sciences, Economics, and Technological and Communication Networks, among others. The conference focuses on interdisciplinary research on all aspects of network science and modeling, ranging from foundational works to applications in various disciplines.</p>

<p>The conference will be in-person only.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us: <a href="mailto:netsci2025@gmail.com">netsci2025@gmail.com</a></p>

</ul>

<p>If your paper is accepted, it will be assigned to either a lecture session or a poster session. Prepare your presentation accordingly, following the guidelines below. The author’s request for an oral or poster presentation is taken into consideration but the final decision to place a paper in a lecture or poster session rests with the evaluation committee.</p>

Presentation by anyone else than one of the co-authors (proxies, video or remote cast) is not allowed unless explicitly approved before the conference by the technical committee. One of the authors must register for the conference and must register before the author registration deadline. Failure to do so will result in automatic withdrawal of the paper from the conference program.</p>

<p>For posters, one author must be present at the poster during the entire duration of the session.</p>

<p>An author cannot present more than 1 accepted paper.</p>

<h3 id="file-format">File Format</h3>

<p>The review process will be performed from the electronic submission of your paper. To ensure that your document is compatible with the review system and proceedings system, you must adhere to the following requirements. Papers must be submitted in Adobe’s Portable Document Format (PDF). These requirements mandate that your files:</p>

<ul>

NetSci Committee does not perform blind reviews, so be sure to include the author list in your submitted paper.
