  Talk title: Network resuscitation – reviving failed networks
  Abstract: 'Complex systems often experience perturbations and disturbances, from
    overload failures in power systems to species extinction in ecological networks.
    The impact of such perturbations is often subtle, the system exhibits a minor
    response, but continues to sustain its global functionality. However, in extreme
    cases, a large enough perturbation may lead to a large-scale collapse, with the
    system abruptly transitioning from a functional to a dysfunctional dynamic state.
    For instance, in cellular dynamics, genetic knockouts, beyond a certain threshold,
    lead to cell death; in ecological systems, changes in environmental conditions
    may, in extreme cases, cause mass-extinction; and in infrastructure networks,
    a cascading failure, at times, results in a major blackout. When such collapse
    occurs, the naïve instinct is to reverse the damage, retrieve the failed nodes
    and reconstruct the lost links. Such response however is seldom efficient, as
    (i) we rarely have access to all system components; (ii) even if we could reverse
    the damage, due to hysteresis, in many cases, the system will not spontaneously
    regain its lost functionality. To address this challenge, we consider here a two-step
    recovery process: Step I. Restructuring. Retrieving the network topology to a
    point where the system can potentially regain functionality • Step II. Reigniting.
    Introducing dynamic interventions to steer the system back to its functional state.
    The challenge in Step II is that we are typically limited in our potential interventions.
    Hence, we seek to reignite the system via micro-interventions, e.g., controlling
    just a single or, at most, few nodes. Therefore, in this talk, we present single-node
    reigniting, unveiling a new dynamic phase of complex systems, in which a failed
    system can be revived by controlling just a microscopic set of nodes. This helps
    jolt the network back to functionality – offering a practical network dynamics
    defibrillator.'

  Talk title: Fractional derivative in continuous-time Markov processes and applications
    to epidemics in networks
  Abstract: Since real-world epidemics are very likely characterized by non-exponential
    infections and curings, non-Markovian models are expected to describe real epidemic
    processes better. In order to account for memory in Markovian stochastic processes,
    we replace the standard differential operator in the Markovian equations with
    the well-known Caputo fractional derivative, an operator which generalizes the
    notion of standard derivative to non-integer orders (i.e., 0 < α < 1) and which
    incorporates memory effects “summing” over the past. We apply it to generalize
    the equations describing Markovian epidemic processes on networks and we prove
    that is possible to define a microscopic epidemic description that is compatible
    with the fractional framework. Without making any assumption on the memory structure
    of the fractional process we obtain bounds for the average fraction of infected
    individuals (i.e., prevalence) and we show that for 0 < α < 1 the fractional epidemics
    is always worse (i.e. more dangerous) than the Markovian epidemics because grows
    faster in the beginning and survives more in the long-run. Assuming that the fractional
    process satisfies the semi-Markov property, which means that the memory of the
    process is reset every time there is an update in the viral state of the network,
    we analytically prove that is possible to define a novel microscopic epidemic
    description that is compatible with the fractional Chapman-Kolmogorov equation.
    Finally we also show under which conditions any fractional stochastic process
    can be reduced to a corresponding Markov process via different kinds of time transformations,
    providing a practical tool to extend the well-known theory of Markovian epidemic
    process to a more general framework.

  Talk title: Interlocking path-dependencies in green industrial strategy networks
  Abstract: 'Green industrial strategy comprises policies that help steer a country''s
    economic structure towards sectors that are cleaner and produce green technologies.
    In both policy practice and the economic literature, green industrial strategy
    has been growing rapidly in popularity. In this study, we use network science
    methods to expose underlying patterns of industrial strategy that drive policy
    innovations. While network science is relatively novel to policy making, existing
    literature has stressed that policy making is a complex, evolving, path-dependent
    process. This paper is the first to study industrial strategy using network science
    and adds to a nascent literature on networks in policymaking. We introduce a new
    dataset of green industrial strategy, spanning policies between 2008--2022 that
    target the value chain of three major renewable energy technologies: solar pv,
    wind energy, and batteries for electric vehicles (EVs). Using this data, we create
    three separate co-occurrence networks of countries, products, and policy instruments.
    We find that industrial strategy is a path dependent process, and that the network
    structure is informative of policy innovation: countries have a tendency to introduce
    new policies if they are more aligned with the policy instruments that are already
    in place, the products that it already targets, or if related countries already
    have that policy in place. We show that the direction of green industrial policy
    can thus - to some extent - be predicted using our networks. One of the three
    networks is of industrial policy instruments, where instruments are connected
    if they are often co-applied to the same product in the same country. Fig. 1 overlays
    the network with a specific policy innovation in India, which was more than four
    times more likely to be introduced in 2017 than in a situation where no related
    policy instrument had already been introduced by India on that product before.'

  Talk title: A Near Linear-time Network Sampling for the Enhanced Configuration Models
  Abstract: 'The configuration model is a popular random graph model that aims to
    generate networks with a specific degree

    sequence [1]. Although the Chung-Lu model is the most commonly used approach,
    it contains inherent biases that make

    it inadequate for accurately representing important network properties. Specifically,
    it fails to properly model clustering

    patterns and nearest neighbor degree distributions that are predicted by the configuration
    model [2]. This limitation leads

    to unreliable significance testing and incorrect interpretations of network characteristics.
    The Enhanced Configuration

    Model (ECM) addresses these issues through maximum entropy principles, providing
    better theoretical grounding and

    accuracy. However, its adoption remains limited due to the computational complexity
    of sampling networks from ECM.

    We propose a fast sampling algorithm for ECM, reducing time complexity to O(M
    ) from O(N 2) for a network with N

    nodes M edges on expectation based on brute force algorithm (BF). We leverage
    the rejection sampling, which operates

    in two key steps. First, we sample potential edges (i, j) using a proposal probability
    q larger than the true probability Pij

    (q ≥ Pij ). Second, we accept each proposed edge with probability Pij /q. The
    first step generates a sparse Erd˝os-R´enyi

    random graph with M ′ ∼ qN 2 edges (where M ′ ≥ E[M ]) in time complexity O(M
    ′) on expectation. In the second

    step, we only need to examine these M ′ candidate edges, which is significantly
    fewer than the N 2 possible node pairs,

    thereby achieving substantial computational speedup. This rejection sampling method
    maintains correct edge probabilities

    (q × Pij /q = Pij ). The efficiency of our approach hinges on choosing q as close
    as possible to Pij to minimize the

    number M ′ of candidate edges. We do so by sorting Pij in descending order and
    dynamically setting qij = P ′

    ij where P ′ij ≥ Pij . Sorting is performed based on the degree di of the nodes,
    as dj′ ≥ di implies Pij′ ≥ Pij .

    Our numerical simulations based on 94 empirical networks of different sizes from
    multiple domains demonstrate

    10∼1000 times speedup in the network sampling (Fig.1a) while preserving the degree
    distribution (Fig.1b). We evaluate

    our proposed method (UECM) by comparing it against two established approaches:
    the BF algorithm for ECM and

    Miller’s algorithm, which implements a biased Chung-Lu model using similar underlying
    principles as described above

    [3]. The results also manifest that BF is the slowest for all networks in terms
    of the CPU time, with complexity roughly

    matching O(N 2) (Fig. 1a), whereas Miller and UECM are substantially faster especially
    for large networks. Miller is

    the fastest algorithm for the Chung-Lu model, and our results indicate that our
    sampling algorithm matches its speed.

    Our algorithm does not compromise the accuracy, as indicated by nearly perfect
    correlations between the original degree

    sequence and that of the sampled networks (Fig.1b), with errors being comparable
    with those for other algorithms.

    Finally, extending this sampling algorithm for the case of directed and weighted
    networks will be the next task. It is

    promising to see that our efficient sampling algorithm will break the adoption
    barrier of the ECM for a more accurate

    analysis and characterization of network structure.'

  Talk title: 'Identifying a Novel Medulloblastoma Subgroup: A Multilayer- and Synthetic-Data-Based
    Approach'
  Abstract: 'Medulloblastoma (MB) is a rare childhood brain tumor historically stratified
    into four molecular subgroups: WNT, SHH, Group 3 (G3), and Group 4 (G4). While
    SHH and WNT are widely accepted as separate subgroups, G3 and G4 are currently
    viewed as a continuum within the non-SHH/non-WNT subgroup. The present work focuses
    on this subgroup continuum, as recent research on various omics datasets has suggested
    the existence of a putative, additional G3-G4 subgroup with intermediate characteristics.
    We present findings that identify and characterize the additional G3-G4 subgroup
    using two distinct omics datasets and two distinct methodologies. First, we characterized
    the putative subgroup based on genes'' persistent association in multilayer network
    communities across multi-omics data, and identified patients that do not belong
    to either the G3 nor the G4 subgroups. Given data scarcity is a common problem
    in rare disease analyses, including in transcriptomic data, in our second procedure
    we sought to overcome this limitation by generating new, synthetic patients within
    the G3-G4 subgroup from a microarray study. By leveraging the Variational Autoencoder
    generative ability, we were able to overcome the problem of data scarcity and
    found quantitative support for the G3-G4 subgroup definition. Overall, we found
    a subset of genes that separate the G3-G4 subgroup, both through our multilayer
    network and synthetic-data approaches. These approaches show the potential of
    overcoming dimensionality limitations across different data types, enhancing rare
    disease subtyping tasks and allowing for a deeper understanding of the underlying
    biology.'

  Talk title: Innovation-exnovation dynamics on trees and trusses
  Abstract: Schumpeterian creative destruction most naturally relates innovation and
    its complement exnovation in a linear progression of realized possibilities from
    the past to the present. The phylogenetic tree is a structural variation that
    represents contingent paths of biological innovations to a species. For a technological
    capability, paths are manifold, or a “truss.” We propose a simple model for a
    population of agents innovating while outrunning exnovation to contrast the impact
    of dynamical parameters with structural ones. We calculate its phase diagram to
    show how dynamics and structural connectivity conspire to unleash innovative diversity
    or to drive it extinct.

  Talk title: Connectivity and Community Structure of Online and Register-based Social
    Networks
  Abstract: The dominance of online social media data as a source for large-scale
    social network studies has recently been challenged by networks constructed from
    state-curated register data. In this paper, we investigate how the two compare,
    focusing the Dutch online social network (OSN) Hyves and a register-based social
    network (RSN) of the Netherlands. First and foremost, we find that the connectivity
    of the two population-scale networks is strikingly similar, especially between
    nearby municipalities, with more long-distance ties captured by the OSN. This
    result holds when correcting for population size and geographical distance, notwithstanding
    that these two factors appear to be the main drivers of connectivity. Second,
    we show that the community structure of neither network follows strict administrative
    geographical delineations (e.g., provinces). Instead, communities appear to either
    center around large metropolitan areas or, outside of the country's most urbanized
    area, are comprised of large blocks of interdependent municipalities. Beyond population
    and distance-related patterns, communities also highlight the persistence of deeply
    rooted sociocultural communities that can be linked to religion. The findings
    presented in this work aid in comparing results from future studies in which online
    social networks and register-based social networks are used to obtain insights
    into the social network structure of an entire population.

  Talk title: Planted clique detection in geometric network models
  Abstract: Random geometric graphs (RGGs) are often used to model real-life social,
    technological and biological networks. An artificial clique may signal anomaly
    or malicious interventions. We study the problem of detecting such a artificial
    (or, hidden, planted) clique in RGGs. Formally, we consider a RGG where n vertices
    are located at random on a finite two-dimensional torus; two vertices are connected
    if the distance between them is at most r. Then, k vertices are chosen at random
    to form a planted clique by adding the missing edges between them. Our goal is
    to design algorithms that find the planted clique with high probability (w.h.p).
    We analyze two algorithms. The vertex degree (VD) algorithm declares that the
    planted clique is the k vertices with highest degrees, just as in the earlier
    literature for the Erdös-Rényi (ER) random graphs. We prove that the VD algorithm
    works for k greater than log(n) times the average degree, similarly to the ER
    model. Interestingly, the largest clique in a RGG is much greater than that. Our
    main contribution is the common neighbor (CN) algorithm that works as follows.
    If a pair of vertices has exactly k-2 common neighbors, then CN declares that
    this pair and its common neighbors are the planted clique. We prove that the CN
    algorithm finds a planted clique w.h.p. in a large range of regimes, for instance
    (surprisingly!) when k is finite, while the average degree is of the order log(n).
    We conclude that even without knowing the positions of the vertices, we can leverage
    the hidden geometry to greatly enhance detection, in comparison to non-geometric
    models.

  Talk title: Benchmarking Algorithmic and Neural Approaches for Temporal Community
    Detection
  Abstract: This work presents an experimental evaluation of algorithmic and neural
    community detection methods for temporal graphs, comparing more established approaches
    with newly introduced deep learning models designed for node-level clustering.
    We devise a novel stochastic block model-based approach 3] to generate time-varying
    attributed temporal graphs with community ground truths, and employ it to compare
    the performance of distinct state-of-the-art solutions. In this framework, node
    features are kept fixed, while community structures are dynamic — allowing to
    study how well differing solutions are able to jointly exploit the feature space
    and the temporal dynamics of the generated graphs to improve on the detectability
    threshold of communities and allow better recovering the hidden community structure
    of the generated networks. In addition, we assess the performance of the models
    on a set of diverse real-world datasets of various scales, focused on a transductive
    learning setting, and extending to an inductive learning setting when possible.
    The main motivation behind this work are the recent advances in network representation
    learning, which have also sparked a renewed interest in the improvement and development
    of new strategies for learning on spatio-temporal signals.

  Talk title: Continuous-time random walker induced temporal graphs
  Abstract: 'We consider a node-set S , whose elements can be interpreted as locations,
    and M random walkers moving betweenthe N = |S| nodes. Each walker has its own
    Markovian mobility process, describing how the walker moves betweenthe nodes of
    S over time. The Markovian mobility process is equivalent to a random walk on
    a Markov graph whosestates are the node-set S . The contact graph G(t), which
    has M nodes, each corresponding to a different walker, isdetermined according
    to the co-location principle. If two walkers m1 and m2 are in the same state n
    ∈ S at a timeˆt, there is an edge between nodes m1 and m2 in G(ˆt). The contact
    graph G(t) has the same clique-structure that iscommon in real-world data: at
    all times, all walkers are part of a clique.The random walker induced temporal
    graph model (RWIG) [1], is originally described in discrete-time. The model isconceptually
    intuitive, analytically tractable and scalable. Here, we extend the discrete-time
    model from [1] to continuoustime. exponential transition times. We show mathematically
    that this modelcan be used to retrieve the heavy-tailed inter-meeting times present
    in the real-world.'

  Talk title: Longitudinal Modularity for Uncovering Dynamic Community Structures
    in Link Streams
  Abstract: 'Complex networks are powerful tools for modeling real-world phenomena,
    including social interactions, economic transactions, and biological processes.
    Many of these phenomena are characterized by a continuous flow of interactions
    occurring at fast time scales, often modeled as stream graphs or link streams,
    frameworks specifically designed to handle fine-grained temporal data without
    unnecessary aggregation. Working within this framework necessitates extending
    methods developed for static networks, including the classic problem of community
    detection. In previous work we focused on the well-known modularity quality function
    for community structures in static networks and introduced an extension for link
    streams: the Longitudinal Modularity. This extension does not require a predefined
    time scale of analysis or any preprocessing of the natural temporal interactions
    in the network. In this work, we present an algorithm designed to identify time
    communities in link streams that maximize Longitudinal Modularity.'

  Talk title: Modeling discovery through the exploration of growing networks of possibility
  Abstract: Studying how we explore the world in search of novelties is key to understand
    the mechanisms that can lead to new discoveries. Previous studies analyzed novelties
    in various exploration processes, defining them as the first appearance of an
    element. However, novelties can also be generated by combining what is already
    known. We hence define higher-order novelties as the first time two or more elements
    appear together, and we introduce higher-order Heaps' exponents as a way to characterize
    their pace of discovery. Through extensive analysis of real-world data, we find
    that processes with the same pace of discovery, as measured by the standard Heaps'
    exponent, can instead differ at higher orders. We then propose to model an exploration
    process as a random walk on a network in which the possible connections between
    elements evolve in time. The model reproduces the empirical properties of higher-order
    novelties, revealing how the network we explore changes over time along with the
    exploration process.

  Talk title: Impact of directionality on the emergence of Turing patterns on m-directed
    higher-order structures
  Abstract: 'Turing patterns, hallmarks of self-organized processes, emerge when ordered
    structures arise from initial disorder due to the complex nonlinear interactions
    between the elements of a system. Initially studied in continuous settings, these
    patterns have recently been explored on networks, where nodes represent spatial
    regions hosting local reactions between two chemical species, the activator and
    the inhibitor, while edges model the diffusion process. This approach has made
    it possible to study Turing instability on graphs, but also on undirected hypergraphs.
    In this work, we develop a theory of Turing instability on m-directed hypergraphs.
    These structures generalize hypergraphs by dividing the nodes of a hyperedge into
    two disjoint sets: tail nodes and head nodes. This directionality introduces a
    privileged mechanism in which the collective action of tail nodes drives the reactions
    involving head nodes. This generalization thus provides an extended framework
    compared to traditional directed networks. Using linear stability analysis, we
    demonstrate that the directionality of m-directed hypergraphs promotes Turing
    instability, enabling the emergence of stationary or wave-like patterns within
    parameter regimes inaccessible to symmetric configurations. We also derive two
    specific Laplace matrices that allow for a rigorous analytical characterization
    of these patterns. The theoretical findings are validated through simulations
    using the Brusselator model, applied to a directed m-hyperring and a directed
    random hypergraph. Our work highlights the crucial role of directionality in the
    emergence of Turing patterns and broadens the traditional frameworks of network
    theory.'

  Talk title: 'Phase Transition in Particles Aggregates: an Application to Biofilm
    Formation'
  Abstract: In this work, we developed a high-performance individual-based simulation
    to investigate biofilm formation driven by mutualistic interactions. Our results
    reveal that the system undergoes a sharp phase transition from a planktonic state
    to a biofilm state as the ratio of mutualistic to competitive interactions increases.
    Furthermore, we find that the critical point of this transition depends on the
    specific topology of the interaction network. Using mathematical arguments, we
    explain this transition as being driven by nucleation processes, characterized
    by the formation of bacterial clusters of critical size that, once established,
    can only grow and not be dismantled. This work not only provides a compelling
    hypothesis that biofilm formation is driven by nucleation processes but also introduces
    a versatile model capable of generating sharp phase transitions, with broad applicability.

  Talk title: Spectral Graph Pruning Against Over-Squashing and Over-Smoothing
  Abstract: 'Message Passing Graph Neural Networks are known to suffer from two problems
    that are sometimes believed to be diametrically opposed: over-squashing and over-smoothing.
    The former results from topological bottlenecks that hamper the information flow
    from distant nodes and are mitigated by spectral gap maximization, primarily,
    by means of edge additions. However, such additions often promote over-smoothing
    that renders nodes of different classes less distinguishable. Inspired by the
    Braess phenomenon, we argue that deleting edges can address over-squashing and
    over-smoothing simultaneously. This insight explains how edge deletions can improve
    generalization, thus connecting spectral gap optimization to a seemingly disconnected
    objective of reducing computational resources by pruning graphs for lottery tickets.
    To this end, we propose a computationally effective spectral gap optimization
    framework to add or delete edges and demonstrate its effectiveness on the long
    range graph benchmark and on larger heterophilous datasets.'

  Talk title: 'Modeling diffusion in networks with communities: a multitype branching
    process approach'
  Abstract: 'The dynamics of diffusion in complex networks are widely studied to understand
    how entities, such as information, diseases, or behaviors, spread in an interconnected
    environment. Complex networks often present community structure, and tools to
    analyze diffusion processes on networks with communities are needed. In this paper,
    we develop theoretical tools using multi-type branching processes to model and
    analyze diffusion processes, following a simple contagion mechanism, across a
    broad class of networks with community structure. We show how, by using limited
    information about the network --- the degree distribution within and between communities
    --- we can calculate standard statistical characteristics of propagation dynamics,
    such as the extinction probability, hazard function, and cascade size distribution.
    These properties can be estimated not only for the entire network but also for
    each community separately. Furthermore, we estimate the probability of spread
    crossing from one community to another where it is not currently spreading. We
    demonstrate the accuracy of our framework by applying it to two specific examples:
    the Stochastic Block Model and a log-normal network with community structure.
    We show how the initial seeding location affects the observed cascade size distribution
    on a heavy-tailed network and that our framework accurately captures this effect.'

  Talk title: Distinguishing isomorphic graphs with persistent homology on a chordless
    cycles filtration
  Abstract: Persistent homology, a technique from computational topology, has recently
    gained attention in graph machine learning. Previous work bridges the gap between
    computational topology and graph machine learning, by analyzing persistent homology
    expressivity for graph learning tasks. However, they do not provide theoretical
    foundations in the choice of graph filtration methods in terms of their expressivity
    as in the k-FWL test. On the other hand, it has been recently shown that a proper
    graph weighting method based on chordless cycles can help identify the latent
    dimension of networks. In this work, we propose a new class of filtrations in
    persistent homology based on the density of edge triangles, squares, and pentagons
    and its application in graph learning. After choosing a filtration, we expand
    the graph by filling in all (k + 1)-cliques with filtration values and calculating
    persistent homology up to dimension k. Our persistent homology calculations result
    in a set of persistence diagrams for each graph, which we compare in a pairwise
    manner using the bottleneck distance, to decide if two graphs are different. We
    address the graph isomorphism problem, aiming to distinguish graphs from various
    datasets like BREC, strongly regular graphs (SSR), minimal Cayley graphs, or cubic
    graphs. Our proposed filtration outperforms curvature- or Laplacian-based filtration
    in the BREC dataset for k = 1 and k = 2. Moreover, for SSRs for k = 1 only our
    filtration can distinguish non-isomorphic graphs. We also study how expressive
    different filtrations are by comparing them to the k-FWL test. Our results demonstrate
    the strength of density-based filtrations in distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs,
    particularly in challenging datasets. Besides graph learning tasks, our method
    could find applications in chemistry or biology. For example, in molecular graphs.
    Density-based filtrations could capture structural variations, complementing existing
    geometric and chemical approaches.

  Talk title: Association between oral microbiota and close-range proximity of children
    in primary school
  Abstract: The human microbiota is a complex ecosystem of microorganisms inhabiting
    the human body and it influences human health and well-being. Recent studies showed
    its interplay with social behavior, suggesting that part of the microbiota might
    be socially transmissible [1, 2]. One of the main challenges encountered in these
    studies is accurately measuring the network of social interactions, typically
    estimated from known, long-standing relations. While information on these associations
    is readily available, using such relationships does not allow the study of the
    microbiota’s similarities among individuals with social contacts reaching beyond
    their closest social circle. We investigate the association between social interactions
    and oral microbiota composition in 35 primary school children. This cohort comprises
    individuals from different families, allowing us to consider interactions beyond
    the familiar social circle. We characterized the participants’ oral microbiota
    with saliva sampling during class hours and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In parallel,
    we objectively measured a close-range proximity network among children with wearable
    sensors, developed by the SocioPatterns collaboration [3]. The results summarized
    in Figure 1 show that prolonged interactions are associated with a significantly
    higher microbiota similarity. We identify a set of 19 taxa whose distribution
    across children better correlates with the structure of the proximity network
    and finally show that the most central children in the proximity network have
    a higher number of these taxa in their microbiota. In conclusion, our study shows
    a strong association between oral microbiota and close-range proximity of non-cohabiting
    children in a primary school setting, complementing the results on cohabiting
    individuals. This suggests that microbiota might be transmitted in social settings,
    and it motivates further research on the interplay between the social network
    structure and the microbiota composition.

  Talk title: Exact probability of a link between two nodes in an Erdős-Rényi random
    graph given their degrees
  Abstract: The probability of a link between two nodes is commonly said to be $d_i
    d_j / (2L-1)$, but this is demonstrably false since it is based on an approximation.
    This probability appears in the formula of Newman’s modularity, which plays a
    crucial rule in detecting community structures in networks. We derive an exact
    analytic form for the probability in simple graphs and show that correcting Newman’s
    modularity formula with our exact probability can lead to different communities
    being detected.

    in the broader network-science community. In legal systems, individuals and institutions
    that operate in different branches of the public or the private sector, at different
    levels of the legal hierarchy (above, on, or below the national level), continuously
    create, modify, and interpret legal texts in response to system-internal and system-external
    stimuli – "the law" emerges from these myriad interactions. As such, legal systems
    are naturally higher-order, multilayer, temporal, adaptive, and intricately coupled
    with other systems (e.g., social, ecological, and technological systems), combining
    features from multiple advanced network models. By demonstrating how legal networks
    are distinct from, yet closely connected to, other topics of interest to network
    scientists, we hope to draw more researchers into this exciting field – and to
    help bring together those already active in the area. Thus, we also argue the
    case for including legal networks in future NetSci calls as a separate category.'

  Talk title: The Temporal Event Graph as a Tool for Modelling Spreading Processes
  Abstract: Understanding how an epidemic spreads through a network is crucial for
    devising effective mitigation strategies. While there exists a large body of literature
    concerning the spread of epidemics on static networks, our understanding of how
    the dynamics of epidemic spreading interact with the temporal properties of a
    network is limited. Although, temporal characteristics, such as burstiness or
    causal temporal motifs, have been shown to fundamentally alter the spread of an
    epidemic, an accessible method of analysing such phenomena is missing. One promising
    approach to tackle this problem has been presented through mapping temporal networks
    to static graphs, which encode the relevant temporal information and unlock static
    network tools for the analysis of temporal networks. The temporal event graph
    representation takes this approach by mapping temporal events into nodes and connecting
    them via links directed forward in time, if they represent temporally adjacent
    event pairs. The result is a causal directed acyclic graph (DAG), which encodes
    all time-respecting paths in the network and allows for advantages computing the
    reachable sets of events. In a temporal network, an event - or node - can be reached
    from a source through time-respecting paths. The set of reachable nodes, or out-component,
    forms an upper bound for a spreading process. This representation maps into a
    reinforcing susceptible-infected-susceptible (rSIS) model evolving on the temporal
    structure, where each event will re-infect an already infected node, thus restarting
    its recovery clock. Importantly, this model appears as an upper bound approximation
    for a conventional SIS process. Our goal in this research is to explore this mapping
    and approximation to understand how we can use the event graph representation
    to study epidemic processes without performing costly simulations.

  Talk title: Geometric separability of mesoscale patterns in embedding representation
    and visualization of multidimensional data and complex networks
  Abstract: A feature of complexity in connected systems is the emergence of mesoscale
    patterns in a geometric space, such as groupings in bird flocks. These patterns
    are formed by groups of points that tend to separate from each other, creating
    mesoscale structures. When multidimensional data or complex networks are embedded
    in a geometric space, some mesoscale patterns can appear respectively as clusters
    or communities, and their geometric separability is a feature according to which
    the performance of an algorithm for network embedding can be evaluated. Here,
    we introduce a framework for the definition and measure of the geometric separability
    (linear and nonlinear) of mesoscale patterns by solving the travelling salesman
    problem (TSP), and we offer experimental evidence on embedding and visualization
    of multidimensional data or complex networks, which are generated artificially
    or are derived from real complex systems. For the first time in literature the
    TSP’s solution is used to define a criterion of nonlinear separability of points
    in a geometric space, hence redefining the separability problem in terms of the
    travelling salesman problem is an innovation which impacts both computer science
    and complexity theory.

  Talk title: Temporal Graph Reproduction with RWIG
  Abstract: We examine the Random Walkers Induced temporal Graph (RWIG) model, which
    generates temporal graphs based on the co-location principle of $M$ independent
    walkers that traverse the underlying Markov graph with different transition probabilities.
    Given the assumption that each random walker is in the steady state, we determine
    the steady-state vector $\Tilde{s}$ and the Markov transition matrix $P_i$ of
    each walker $w_i$ that can reproduce the observed temporal network \(G_0,{...},G_{K{-}1}\)
    with the lowest mean squared error. We also show how to identify the number of
    states $N$ and the initial Markov graph of $M$ walkers from the $K$-length contact
    sequence of the random walkers. Finally, we examine the performance of RWIG for
    periodic temporal graph sequences.

  Talk title: Localization Transitions and Autocorrelations in Contact-Based Social
    Contagion Models on Multiplex Networks
  Abstract: 'Understanding localization transitions in multiplex networks is crucial
    for characterizing the interplay between structure and dynamics in real techno-social
    systems. In this work[1], we study a class of contact-based social contagion models
    that interpolate between contact processes and fully reactive SIS dynamics, depending
    on a tunable parameter. Our approach enable the exploration of two key transitions:
    the localized-to-delocalized regimes transition and the dominance switching between
    network layers.Using perturbative analysis, we derive an analytical expression
    for the coupling parameter p* that governs the localized-to-delocalized transition.
    Our analytical results match previous numerical findings, including the universal
    scaling laws in the Inverse Participation Ratio (IPR)[2], which further validate
    the robustness of our approach across different network models.Expanding on these
    findings[3], we explore the role of autocorrelations in time-series data as early
    warning signals for these transitions. This approach bridges spectral and temporal
    analyses, offering a unified framework to anticipate regime changes in multiplex
    systems.By combining spectral and temporal indicators, our results provide a deeper
    understanding of structural and dynamical transitions in multiplex networks, with
    broad applications in studying information spreading in online social media.1.

  Talk title: Misinformation spreading through chain emails
  Abstract: Nowadays, it is challenging to check the information circulating among
    people, which often contains misinformation. Misinformation spreads through a
    diverse set of channels, so its understanding requires investigating diverse channels,
    including email communication. For example, in Czechia misinformation spreads
    through chain emails, which has been observed by about 33% of the population.
    In this work, we have explored a curated dataset of chain emails circulating in
    Czech cyberspace related to the conflict in Ukraine from January 2020 until July
    2024 and cross-referenced them with raw email communication records. First, we
    have investigated the typical information sources and mentioned entities with
    different sentiments. To get a better insight into the relationships among the
    mentioned entities, we studied a sentiment co-occurrence network. Its maximal
    spanning tree reveals three major communities surrounding Russia, USA, and Czech
    politics, with USA having the most central role. We have also identified the most
    common topics in the chain emails by combining BERTopic and GPT-4o mini, and characterized
    their sentiment. Because the sentiment was mostly negative, we analyzed the toxicity,
    which showed significant toxicity scores. To investigate how much these chain
    emails are spread in the population, we have cross-referenced them with pseudonymized
    emails based on the subject, links, and hashes of the email body and examined
    the number of matches and unique senders and receivers. For example, by considering
    the number of subject&hash matches, the topics 'media and propaganda' and 'military
    conflict' appear as most prevalent, while 'demonstrations' and 'energy policy'
    are least prevalent. We are also studying the spreading dynamics of the chain
    emails over the users’ network. Overall, our study demonstrates how misinformation
    on various topics, different sentiments, and toxicity spreads among people through
    chain emails, which is the first of this kind.
