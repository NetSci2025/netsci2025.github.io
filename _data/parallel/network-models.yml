  Talk title: Community Structure in Markov Influence Graphs with Heterogeneous Holding
    Times
  Abstract: Uncovering the community structure within complex networks is key to understanding
    their functional units, dynamics, and organizational patterns. However, popular
    community detection approaches like modularity optimization are NP-hard and sensitive
    to initial conditions. The KDA, based on the Markov Influence Graph (MIG) framework,
    offers a deterministic, polynomial-time solution. Currently, both the KDA algorithm
    and the fundamental analysis of MIGs rely on long-run characteristics of random
    walkers in discrete time, such that each random walker spends an equal amount
    of time at each node. In this paper, we extend the model to a continuous time
    model by allowing for the random walker to spend heterogeneous times at nodes.
    For example, in a social network, each agent (node) may take varying amounts of
    time to pass on or process a piece of information (i.e., the random walker), meaning
    the walker can spend different time durations at different nodes. Through both
    simulation and empirical applications, we demonstrate that incorporating a time
    dimension significantly impacts the community structure of a network. Our algorithm
    offers wide-ranging applications, from social sciences, economics, and finance
    to the natural sciences, providing a new lens for exploring complex systems.

  Talk title: Cyclic Random Graphs Predicting Giant Molecules in Hydrocarbon Pyrolysis
  Abstract: Various structures arising in nature can be modeled using random graphs.
    We propose to use random graphs for describing the molecular composition in the
    hydrocarbon pyrolysis, a complex chemical reaction system with two atom types,
    carbon and hydrogen. The ensemble of the carbon skeletons of the molecules makes
    up a realization of a random graph. Our goal is to design a random graph model
    that yields accurate predictions for the molecule size distribution and the size
    of the largest molecule for any initial composition and any temperature within
    certain ranges. The locally tree-like behavior – i.e. that neighborhoods of nodes
    are almost always trees and that small loops are rare – underlies many classical
    random graph models, including the configuration model [1]. However, many real
    networks exhibit small loops with non-zero density. We argue that loops are crucial
    for measuring emergent properties of networks, such as the size of the largest
    connected component. In particular, carbons tend to form small loops peaking at
    the size of five, as observed from the molecular simulation data (Figs. 1a—b).
    The presence of these loops reduces the size of the giant component approximately
    by a factor of 2.We propose a random graph model featuring disjoint loops as an
    analytically tractable model for real networks with sparse loops. We observe this
    model has assortative mixing by degree, where edges connect nodes of similar degrees.
    Ultimately, our proposed model has disjoint loops and does not exhibit assortative
    mixing by degree [2]. The model uses works of Karrer and Newman [3] and Newman
    [4] as building blocks.We apply the proposed model to hydrocarbon pyrolysis and
    demonstrate that it accurately predicts the size distribution for small molecules
    as well as the size distribution of the largest molecule in reaction systems at
    the pressure of 40.5 GPa, temperature range of 3200K–5000K, and H/C ratio range
    from 2.25 as in octane through 4 as in methane – see Fig. 1c.

  Talk title: Can driving mechanisms of contact duration distributions be distinguished?
  Abstract: 'Human contact networks such as face-to-face interaction, email exchange,
    and phone communication often display power-law contact duration distributions
    with potential cutoffs. One class of models associate each contact with a time-independent
    persistent probability η, leading to an exponentially decaying probability distribution
    for individual contact durations with a given η. The observed long tail in the
    marginal distribution is an aggregate effect of the contact persistence distribution
    ρ(η), which may arise from various factors. Another class of models accounts for
    self-reinforcement of agents, i.e., “the longer an agent interacts with a group,
    the less likely it is to leave”. In these models, the contact persistence probability
    η(t) is a function of the time t, and an increasing η(t) leads to a contact duration
    distribution that intrinsically decays slower than exponentially. The two classes
    of models represent two different generative mechanisms: (I) aggregate effect
    of time homogeneous processes, versus (II) intrinsic time-heterogeneous processes.In
    this study, we analytically discuss the two model classes and reveal their mathematical
    relationship. Moreover, we aim to examine whether it is possible to empirically
    distinguish which mechanism is truly at work, when both mechanisms can produce
    the same observed contact duration data. This task is non-trivial because it is
    impossible to distinguish the two mechanisms by controlling the time t and observing
    the conditional persistence probability. To this end, we analyse two datasets
    of human-LLM (Large Language Model) conversations where the content of multi-turn
    interactions between humans and LLMs is recorded, as well as four human face-to-face
    interaction networks. The survival modeling framework will be used in an attempt
    to distinguish between the two mechanisms. To this end, Bayesian inference will
    be used, as it allows for the quantification of evidence for or against the two
    competing mechanisms.'

  Talk title: Functional reducibility of higher-order networks
  Abstract: '(Full abstract in PDF) Higher-order networks encode more information
    than pairwise interactions: for example, some metabolic reactions can only take
    place if three or more reactants are present, but this information would not be
    captured by pairwise interactions.However, this modeling flexibility comes at
    a cost: new data needs to be adequately recorded, and new analytical andcomputational
    tools need to be developed. Moreover, the complexity and computational cost of
    these tools increaseexponentially as larger group interactions are considered.
    It is therefore crucial to understand under which conditionshigher-order representations
    need to be favored over classical pairwise ones.Here [2], we propose a principled
    approach to optimally compress systems with higher-order interactions—accounting
    for the complexity of the data and the complexity of the model. Specifically,
    we determine an optimal order of interactions up to which interactions need be
    considered to obtain a functionally optimal representation of the system—larger
    orders can be safely discarded.Formally, we do so by generalizing the concept
    of network density matrix [3] to account for higher-order diffusivedynamics with
    the multiorder Laplacian [4] and calculate a (modified) message length corresponding
    to each order.By minimizing this message length, in the spirit of the original
    minimum message length principle, we find the optimalcompression of the data.
    We refer to this procedure as functional reduction. A higher-order network is
    fully reducible—to a pairwise network—if the optimal order is 1, while its reducibility
    decreases for increasing optimal orders. We demonstrate the validity of our method
    by performing an extensive analysis of synthetic networks and investigate the
    functional reducibility of a broad spectrum of real-world higher-order systems.'

  Talk title: Stronger together? The homophily trap in networks
  Abstract: 'While homophily---the tendency to link with similar others---may nurture
    a sense of belonging and shared values, it can also hinder diversity and widen
    inequalities. Here, we unravel this trade-off analytically, revealing homophily
    traps for minority groups: scenarios where increased homophilic interaction among
    minorities negatively affects their structural opportunities within a network.
    We demonstrate that homophily traps arise when minority size falls below 25% of
    a network, at which point homophily comes at the expense of lower structural visibility
    for the minority group. Our work reveals that social groups require a critical
    size to benefit from homophily without incurring structural costs, providing insights
    into core processes underlying the emergence of group inequality in networks.'
