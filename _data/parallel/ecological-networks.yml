  Talk title: Microbial co-occurrence networks in soil ecology do not model functional
    links
  Abstract: 'Ecological networks model species-to-species interactions, and are intended
    to be predictive models for an ecosystem. We infer ecological networks from observational
    data, and often assume precision and recall, i.e., that (1) a network link reflects
    a true pairwise functional relationship between species, and (2) all true relationship
    are modelled as links. Unfortunately, for ecosystems such as the soil, where the
    species are both numerous and microscopic, functional information is rare because
    the individual interactions cannot be observed in the field. Instead, spatial
    co-occurrence networks are inferred from sampling data. We ask the question: how
    accurate are these spatial co-occurrence networks of microorganisms, as inferred
    with current soil-sampling methods? No prior result on this question is available
    in soil ecology.Method. An agent-based model with biologically realistic behaviour
    and parametrisation simulates a plot of land, with true trophic links between
    species. We observe the spatial co-occurrence that these trophic links naturally
    produce in space (with or without an equilibrium state, step 2). We also simulate
    the taking of samples from this spatial distribution of species. Finally, we evaluate
    the accuracy of the co-occurrence network inferred from samples, against the true
    co-occurrence of the plot.Results. We find that biological properties other than
    the interactions, such as species diversity, can be estimated with relatively
    low error with sample pooling. On the other hand, the inference of the co-occurrence
    network is poor. We see high errors of the pairwise link weights, with mean errors
    around 0.5 and very large standard deviations between experiments. The co-occurrence
    network inferred is thus both inaccurate and unstable (explaining the large differences
    seen among algorithms for co-occurrence inference), and this is intuitively explainable
    in spatial terms.'

  Talk title: Species abundance distributions predict maintenance of mobile genetic
    elements in microbial systems
  Abstract: Mobile genetic elements appear in nearly all microbial systems and affect
    ecological processes and, subsequently, macroscopic quantities such as system
    stability and composition. However, little is known about how the spread of these
    elements through horizontal gene transfer is affected by ecological processes,
    or how this spread affects population dynamics. We discuss a model that allows
    one to leverage techniques from epidemiology to predict whether mobile genetic
    elements are maintained. Our results show that maintenance depends on the species
    abundance distribution, thus advancing our understanding of the connection between
    ecological and epidemiological processes.

  Talk title: How did the energy transfer network of green plants help them evolve?
  Abstract: In green plants, there exist two diﬀerent types of chlorophylls, chlorophyll-a
    and chlorophyll-b, in light-harvesting proteins. Although the characteristics
    of individual chlorophyll are well understood, the advantages of their coexistence
    yet to be understood. In this study, we simulate excitation energy transfer within
    the entire photosystem II supercomplex by employing network analysis integrated
    with quantum dynamic calculations. We consider the energy transfer process as
    a Markov process and numerically trace the energy ﬂow during photosynthesis. The
    result shows that the natural chlorophyll composition allows the excited energy
    to preferentially ﬂow through speciﬁc domains that act as safety valves, preventing
    downstream overﬂow. We also investigate the inﬂuence of the proportion between
    chlorophyll-a and chlorophyll-b on the photosystem by comparing various chlorophyll
    compositions. Our ﬁndings suggest that the light-harvesting proteins in a photosystem
    II supercomplex achieve evolutionary advantages with the natural chlorophyll-a/b
    ratio, capturing light energy eﬃciently and safely across various light intensities.
    Through this study, we propose a novel method to investigate the photosystem with
    which one can better understand how green plants harvest light energy and adapt
    to changing environmental conditions.

  Talk title: Competition between pathogenic elements using a pathogen-centric framework
  Abstract: Natural ecosystems exhibit remarkable diversity and stability, yet the
    underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Pathogens, often overlooked in ecological
    models, play a crucial role in maintaining these dynamics. Focusing on microbial
    systems—characterised by large pathogen diversity—we address the challenges of
    scaling models to accommodate large, complex infection networks. Employing a pathogen-centric
    framework, we investigate how pathogen traits and competition for limited hosts
    influence maintenance and, consequently, their ecological impact. These findings
    offer insights into the interplay between ecological and epidemiological processes,
    providing a foundation for future studies on pathogen-driven stability and community
    composition.

  Talk title: Extinctions in microbiomes are driven by carrying capacities and interaction
    network density
  Abstract: Mean abundance distributions (MADs) are important observables to understand
    biodiversity and community structure in ecological systems, often following a
    lognormal distribution in microbial communities. Using a stochastic Lotka-Volterra
    model, we investigate the impact of interaction networks and species-specific
    carrying capacities on MADs and extinction dynamics. Interaction networks are
    modeled as random Erdős-Rényi graphs, with both directed and undirected types.
    Directed networks refer to commensalism or amensalism, while undirected networks
    describe competition between species. For dense networks, MADs deviate from the
    lognormal distribution, becoming increasingly skewed. Our results show that species
    abundances depend on carrying capacities, while network connectivity has a lesser
    influence. Extinction rates rise with network density and interaction strength,
    also occurring within small sub-communities represented by disconnected network
    components. In brief, we have studied the effect of the carrying capacity and
    the interaction network density on species abundances and extinction rates. This
    work, which is currently in preparation, highlights the influence of the distribution
    of carrying capacities and the interaction network on community composition.

  Talk title: Pangraphs as models of higher-order interactions
  Abstract: Graphs have long served as effective models for pairwise interactions,
    providing insights into fundamental properties of trophic and mutualistic networks.
    However, it is now recognized that non-pairwise (higher-order) interactions significantly
    influence the stability of underlying dynamical systems. Hypergraphs, where edges
    can connect arbitrary subsets of vertices, have been proposed as models capable
    of incorporating such interactions. Yet, their application to interaction modifications
    often obscures the roles of individual vertices and amplifies centrality measures.In
    this work, we present an extension of the hypergraph concept that more consistently
    represents complex higher-order interactions, including the modification of information.
    We introduce the concept of a pangraph, as an extension of the ubergraph [2] into
    directed graphs, which allows edges to start and/or end at other edges at arbitrary
    levels of nesting. In this talk, we will explore the properties of pangraphs,
    their relationship to classical directed graphs through the Levi representation,
    and propose centrality measures for these structures. Additionally, we will discuss
    potential methods for extending the pangraph concept to metric graphs dynamics.Finally,
    we demonstrate two compelling applications of pangraphs. The first applies the
    pangraph framework to structures the theory of Petri nets with catalysts. The
    second challenges the hypothesis about the importance of interaction modifications
    presented in [1]. Using a real-world coffee ecosystem database, we show that the
    results in [1] can be interpreted as the amplification of centrality measures
    in the hypergraph approach.

  Talk title: Assortative dispersal facilitates the maintenance of alternative stable
    states
  Abstract: Many ecological communities exhibit alternative stable states where the
    outcome of community assembly depends on both the nature of species interactions
    and the history of the assembly process. Although only a single stable state can
    be realized locally, multiple alternative states could be realized at the regional
    level if local communities undergo sufficiently distinct assembly histories. However,
    alternative states are not easily maintained because dispersal in the system tends
    to homogenize local communities, creating correlations that effectively reduce
    the number of distinct histories, and thus, decreasing the probability of realizing
    different alternative states. Despite this, empirical studies have found natural
    systems in which alternative states persist even in the presence of frequent dispersal.
    To address the apparent gap between theoretical understanding and observations,
    we conducted numerical experiments of a two-species competition model embedded
    in a spatially-explicit landscape where alternative states arise when species
    compete more strongly with heterospecifics than conspecifics. We tested the hypothesis
    that assortative dispersal – individuals preferentially disperse into patches
    containing more conspecifics – can expedite the formation of spatial structure
    that acts to buffer the homogenising effects of dispersal and facilitate the maintenance
    of alternative states. Contrary to expectations, we found that although assortative
    dispersal facilitates the maintenance of alternative states it limits the extent
    of spatial structure that forms. This occurs because assortative dispersal minimizes
    the impact of heterospecifics in adjacent patches, preventing local dominance
    from percolating across the whole landscape. Furthermore, we found that these
    results are robust against variation in the strengths of interspecific interaction,
    disturbance rates, and dispersal costs. We discuss our results in the context
    of niche theory.

  Talk title: Functional Motifs in Food Webs and Networks
  Abstract: When studying a complex system it is often useful to think of the system
    as a network of interacting units. One can then ask if some properties of the
    entire network are already rooted in a small part of the network–a network motif.We
    say a motif is functional when observing one copy of a motif in a large network
    already guarantees a network-level property, regardless of the rest of the network.A
    famous example of a functional ecological motif is the exploitative competition
    in food webs, where the presence of two species competing for a shared resource
    precludes the existence of a stable equilibrium for the whole network. In ecology
    the discovery of this motif has led to the formulation of the competitive-exclusion
    principle that has shaped the field and inspired many subsequent advances. However,
    other examples of motifs with such direct implications on ecological stability
    are not known.In this talk we explain why the exploitative competition is a functional
    stability motif and also why such motifs are rare in food webs and other networked
    systems, such as epidemic spreading and supply chain dynamics. Building on these
    results we then discuss more broadly under which conditions functional motifs
    exist. Perhaps more importantly we show that functional motifs that have implications
    other than asymptotic instability are common in networks from applications.
