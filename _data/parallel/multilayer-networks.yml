  Talk title: Multigraph reconstruction via nonlinear random walks
  Abstract: Network science provides a powerful framework for modeling complex systems,
    where the intricate interplay between structure and dynamics often leads to the
    emergence of complex behaviors such as synchronization and collective motion.
    Random walks, as one of the most studied stochastic processes, play a central
    role in exploring this interplay. However, traditional models often assume independent
    random walkers, overlooking real-world constraints such as finite carrying capacities
    at nodes. Addressing this limitation, recent studies introduced nonlinear diffusion
    processes that account for node capacity limits, enabling the inference of network
    structure through localized measurements and inverse problem-solving. In this
    work, we extend these nonlinear diffusion models to multigraphs, where nodes are
    connected by multiple types of links, each carrying distinct attributes. Examples
    of such systems include air transport networks categorized by airlines or social
    networks differentiated by interaction platforms. We show how the degree distribution
    of an entire multigraph can be reconstructed by combining knowledge of one link
    type with stationary density measurements from a single node. Through simulations
    on diverse multigraph topologies, including Erdős-Rényi, Watts-Strogatz, and scale-free
    networks, we evaluate the reconstruction accuracy and robustness of the proposed
    approach. Our findings demonstrate the capability to accurately infer key structural
    properties, such as degree distribution and moments, even under varying levels
    of sparsity and topology. This study strengthens the connection between network
    dynamics and topology, offering a novel framework for structural inference in
    multigraphs with limited information.

  Talk title: 'Multilayer network inference via redundancy removal: linking the exposome
    to multiomics in human health'
  Abstract: 'Due to the widespread digitization of biomedical and behavioral data,
    there has been a breakthrough in our abil-

    ity to characterize often overlooked exposome factors in disease, such as social
    interactions, psychological states, and

    behavioral patterns such as medical treatments, drug use, drinking habits and
    diet. This is particularly important to

    study chronic health conditions which unfold as a complex interplay among biological,
    psychological, linguistic, and

    societal multiscale factors that change over time and which traditional organism
    models cannot capture. The recent

    availability of heterogeneous multiomics and unconventional data from electronic
    health records, social media, and

    digital cohorts, as well as computational and theoretical advances in characterizing
    multivariate, multilayer complex

    systems, raise the prospect of “digital twins” in precision medicine, whereby
    the behavior of a cell, sub-system, organ

    or a whole organism can be accurately simulated to predict disease and intervention
    outcomes [1].

    Towards that goal, in this presentation we will sum-

    marize our multilayer network reduction methodology

    used to uncover multiscale factors in disease (Figure 1).

    In particular, we show that using distance backbones [2]

    and effective graphs [3] to remove redundant edges or in-

    teractions from network models obtained from biochem-

    ical and social data, reveals optimal information trans-

    mission and regulatory pathways. This greatly facili-

    tates explainable inference, which is essential in biomed-

    ical settings. Indeed, by removing large proportions of

    redundant associations and interactions, it is feasible to

    use the remaining ones to directly backtrack to empir-

    ical evidence, i.e. the data items used to characterize

    correlational strength or information about causal dy-

    namics when available. We demonstrate the approach

    with results from papers published or under review in

    the last year: [1,4,5,6,7,8]. Finally, we demonstrate that

    our network reduction approach naturally extends to multilayer networks. This
    is exemplified with recent studies of

    multi-organism male infertility from protein interaction networks [9] and patient-centered
    integration and analysis

    of heterogeneous data sources in epilepsy, ranging from social media data to electronic
    health records [10,11'

  Talk title: INFORMED INTER-BRAIN COUPLING IMPROVES PREDICTIONS OF MENTAL HEALTH
    OUTCOMES
  Abstract: Multilayer networks are an effective tool for studying variability across
    an ensemble of networks [1-3]. Traditionally, coupling between layers is defined
    uniformly by a single parameter, but this approach risks mischaracterizing variability
    that is consequential for brain function. We leverage the richness of the Human
    Connectome Project dataset, pitting the uniform model against the informed model
    to predict a suite of outcome measures. For both models, layer l is defined by
    subject l’s brain network, as indexed by the Pearson correlation of the time series
    of the 100 region Schaefer parcellation (see Fig 1a). In the uniform model, all-to-all
    coupling of layers (i.e., inter-brain coupling) is defined traditionally (see
    Fig 1b). Inter-brain coupling in the informed model is defined by computing the
    correlation between all subjects across 9 measures of the social environment (see
    Fig 1c) and using a mixture model that allows us to tune how much social context
    similarity informs interlayer coupling (see Fig 1d). We use flexibility and community
    assignments to compare how well these models predict 37 outcome measures. Community
    structure of the uniform coupling model is dominated by two communities (see Fig
    1e). The flexibility of nodes across canonical brain systems varies as expected
    (see Fig 1f). We found moderate to no predictive power of the uniform model on
    the outcome measures (see Fig 1g). As inter-brain coupling is increasingly informed
    by social context similarity, we see greater diversity in community assignments
    (see Fig 1h), a shift in canonical systems’ flexibility (see Fig 1i), and an improvement
    on some predictions, e.g. mental health (see Fig 1j). Informed inter-brain coupling
    in a multilayer model provides useful context for understanding variability in
    brain network organization. This context serves to improve predictions on associations
    with mental health outcomes, which has consequences for the identification of
    brain-network based biomarkers.

  Talk title: Multilayer Network Clustering to Assess Epidemic Model Dependence
  Abstract: Each year, the CDC hosts the FluSight Forecast Challenge, where over 40
    teams contribute to the flu forecasts. To create an ensemble forecast, the CDC
    takes the median of each quantile prediction across all models, assuming each
    provides statistically independent information. However, this assumption may not
    always hold, as models may share analytical frameworks, code, data, or calibrate
    on the same target variables (e.g. flu season peaks). The focus is to isolate
    sources of independent error and identify clusters of similar models to better
    understand ensemble performance and limitations.Using methodologies from climate
    forecasting, we first quantify the “effective number” of independent models by
    isolating independent noise from predictions. Our findings reveal that the effective
    number of models providing unique information is around 6—far fewer than the total
    number of models—indicating significant redundancy in the FluSight ensemble. This
    emphasizes a significant limitation in the current ensemble approach, where non-independent
    contributions may inflate the perceived diversity of forecasts.To further explore
    model dependencies, we apply a multilayer network clustering approach, combining
    similarity measures and multilayer community detection to cluster models with
    shared error patterns. Synthetic data experiments validate the pipeline’s robustness,
    correctly identifying ground truth groupings with independent, group-specific,
    and correlated noise. When applied to FluSight models, we observe temporal inconsistencies
    in groupings, likely driven by updates to individual models throughout the flu
    season.Our results highlight the need to address model interdependencies in epidemic
    forecasting. By quantifying the effective number of independent models and providing
    tools to isolate independent error, we offer a framework for improving ensemble
    reliability. These insights are essential for enhancing forecast accuracy and
    supporting public health decision-making.

  Talk title: Homophily Within and Across Groups
  Abstract: Traditional social network analysis often reduces homophily—the tendency
    of similar individuals to connect—to a single parameter, neglecting nuanced biases
    within and across groups. We propose an exponential family model that incorporates
    both local homophily (strong ties within cliques) and global homophily (weaker
    ties across communities), using a maximum entropy approach to analyze their effects
    on network dynamics under percolation. This framework decomposes homophily into
    finer levels, revealing how these interactions shape the spread of information,
    diseases, and innovation. Testing on diverse datasets, the model highlights how
    varying homophily patterns influence percolation thresholds and the effectiveness
    of interventions, offering valuable insights for public health strategies, social
    media information flow, and targeted mitigation efforts.
