  Talk title: Interplay of synchronization and cortical input in models of brain networks
  Abstract: It is well known that synchronization patterns and coherence play a major
    role in the functioning of brain networks,both in pathological and in healthy
    states [1]. In particular, in the perception of sound, one can observe an increase
    incoherence between the global dynamics in the network and the auditory input
    [2]. Here we show that synchronizationscenarios are determined by a fi ne interplay
    between network topology, the location of the input, and frequencies of thesecortical
    input signals [3]. To this end, we analyze the infl uence of an external stimulation
    in a network of FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators with empirically measured structural
    connectivities, and discuss diff erent areas of cortical stimulation, including
    the auditory cortex.[1] Schöll, E., Partial synchronization patterns in brain

  Talk title: The Human Brain as a Combinatorial Complex
  Abstract: Understanding the brain's complex network structure requires innovative
    mathematical frameworks that can capture its multiscale nature. Higher-order mathematical
    representations, particularly topological data analysis (TDA), have already demonstrated
    value in revealing organizational principles of brain function that remain hidden
    in traditional network approaches [1]. While these approaches and traditional
    network science have provided valuable insights, the integration of higher-order
    approaches with modern machine learning frameworks presents new opportunities
    for understanding brain organization. We propose representing brain networks as
    combinatorial complexes (CCs) [2], a novel mathematical structure developed within
    topological deep learning (TDL) that can simultaneously encode hierarchical and
    set-type relationships in neural systems (Figure 1).As neuroscience transitions
    into the era of big data and machine learning, we propose a computational framework
    for mapping brain network data to higher-order domains. Our CC-based framework
    aims to enrich traditional connectivity information by capturing the synchronic
    interplay between multiple brain regions and their dependencies. Our preliminary
    experiments with topological lifting methods for preserving network structure
    show promising results [3]. And by incorporating explainable AI techniques, our
    framework ensures that the derived insights remain interpretable and meaningful
    to neuroscientists.Using fMRI data, we examine how CC representations capture
    neural organization patterns compared to traditional graph-based analyses. This
    mathematical representation works seamlessly with combinatorial complex neural
    networks (CCNNs), providing a natural bridge between TDL and neuroscience. Our
    approach extends beyond traditional graph neural networks (GNNs) while maintaining
    interpretability, offering a foundation for understanding how higher-order brain
    structures give rise to cognition and behavior.

  Talk title: The exponential distance rule based network model predicts topology
    and reveals functionally relevant properties of the Drosophila projectome
  Abstract: Studying structural brain networks has witnessed significant advancement
    in recent decades. Findings revealed a geometric principle, the exponential distance
    rule (EDR) showing that the number of neurons decreases exponentially with the
    length of their axons. This neuron-level information was used to build a region-level
    EDR network model that was able to explain various characteristics of inter-areal
    cortical networks in macaques, mice, and rats.The complete connectome of the Drosophila
    has recently been mapped providing information also about the network of neuropils
    (projectome). A recent study demonstrated the presence of the EDR in Drosophila,
    which we revisit in our study by precisely measuring the characteristic decay
    rate. This parameter is needed for testing the validity of the EDR random network
    model. Next, we demonstrate that the EDR model effectively accounts for numerous
    binary and weighted properties of the projectome. We also analyze the modularity
    of the projectome with a hierarchical clustering method that provides a realistic
    modular structure, with symmetric organization and clusters localized in space.Our
    study illustrates that the EDR model is a suitable null model for analyzing networks
    of brain regions, as it captures properties of region-level networks in very different
    species. The importance of the null model lies in its ability to facilitate the
    identification of functionally significant features not caused by inevitable geometric
    constraints, as we illustrate with the pronounced asymmetry of connection weights
    important for functional hierarchy. We also provide a first attempt to build this
    hierarchy of brain regions using the introduced asymmetry measure.

  Talk title: The multiscale self-similarity of the weighted human brain connectome
  Abstract: Anatomical connectivity between different brain regions can be mapped
    to a network representation, the connectome, where the intensities of the links,
    the weights, influence resilience and functional processes. Yet, many features
    associated with these weights are not fully understood, particularly their multiscale
    organization. In this paper, we elucidate the architecture of weights, including
    weak ties, in multiscale human brain connectomes reconstructed from empirical
    data. Our findings reveal multiscale self-similarity, including the ordering of
    weak ties, in every individual connectome and group representative. This phenomenon
    is captured by a renormalization technique, based on a geometric model that replicates
    weak and strong ties across all length scales. The observed symmetry represents
    a signature of criticality in the weighted connectivity of the human brain and
    raises important questions for future research, such as the existence of symmetry
    breaking at some scale or whether it is preserved in cases of neurodegeneration
    or psychiatric disorder.

  Talk title: The metric backbone of brain networks across lifespan and hemispheres
  Abstract: 'Communication pathways in the brain are represented by a network of structural
    connectivity between regions. This representation, referred to as a connectome,
    also quantifies the strength of edges and contains important information to understand
    signal propagation in the brain. Some edges of a connectome may be redundant for
    communication. Removing redundancy reveals a subgraph of the connectome, called
    the metric backbone (MB), containing all of its original nodes and the subset
    of edges that obey the triangle inequality. Identifying the MB quantifies the
    robustness of communication via an algebraically principled and exact network
    sparsification method. We investigate human connectomes from the NKI study for
    567 subjects from about 6 to 85 years old. Nodes correspond to brain regions,
    and edge distance weights are inversely proportional to the density of white matter
    streamlines. For each connectome, we compute the MB as described in [3] and implemented
    in the distanceclosure package [8]. The relative backbone size, τ, gives the fraction
    of edges contributing to shortest-path communication. Our analysis reveals very
    small MBs: τ ∈ (0.13, 0.19) with τavg ≈ 0.15, which are smaller than previously
    known for the connectome of a single subject (τ ≈ 0.18), and for c-elegans (τ
    ≈ 0.47). We also find a significant and robust decrease in τ with age in the initial
    30 years, which remains stable for the next 20 years, while a slight increase
    is observed for older age groups, albeit with much greater variation. Finally,
    we observe that backbones contain similar proportions of edges from each brain
    hemisphere until 50 years. Afterwards, the fraction of intra-hemisphere edges
    has a significant increase with age. Biologically, they suggest that brain communication
    becomes more robust in the initial 3 decades of life, but it also becomes a little
    more entrenched in each hemisphere with age.'

  Talk title: Brain-inspired sparse training in deep artificial neural networks with
    network science modelling via Cannistraci-Hebb rule
  Abstract: 'The prevalent fully connected architecture of neural network models is
    computationally inefficient, exceeding the energy expenditure of the human brain
    by over 100-fold. In contrast, the brain''s connectivity is sparse and efficient,
    learning with just a few watts. Brain-inspired network science research can play
    a relevant role in designing low-consumption and efficient deep learning. Sparse
    training (ST) aims to ameliorate deep learning by replacing fully connected artificial
    neural networks (ANNs) with sparse or ultra-sparse ones, such as brain networks
    are.We introduce epitopological learning and Cannistraci-Hebb sparse training
    (CHT), a brain-inspired network science methodology that is gradient free and
    adopt the mere network topology for predicting the sparse connectivity in dynamic
    sparse training of neural networks. Epitopological learning is a field of network
    science and complex network intelligence that studies how to implement learning
    on complex networks by changing the shape of their connectivity structure (epitopological
    plasticity). One way to implement Epitopological (epi- means new) Learning is
    via link prediction: predicting the likelihood of non-observed links to appear
    in the network. Cannistraci-Hebb learning theory inspired the CH3-L3 network automata
    rule effective for general-purpose link prediction. Results show that CHT can
    surpass the performance of fully connected networks with MLP architecture by using
    only 1% of the connections (99% sparsity) and significantly reducing the active
    neuron network size to 20% of the original nodes on three basic datasets, demonstrating
    improved generalization while decreasing model size. Remarkable results are achieved
    also with 0.1% of the connections (99.9% sparsity). We present evidence in Transformers
    and LLMs across different sparsity levels, where CHT outperforms other prevalent
    dynamic sparse training methods in tasks such as Machine Translation, Arithmetic
    Reasoning, and Language Modelling.'

  Talk title: Neuromorphic dendritic network computation with silent synapses for
    visual motion perception
  Abstract: Neuromorphic technologies often employ a point-neuron model, neglecting
    the spatiotemporal nature of neuronal computation. Dendritic morphology and synaptic
    organization are structurally tailored for spatiotemporal information processing,
    enabling various computations such as visual perception. Here, we introduce a
    neuromorphic computational model termed ‘dendristor’, which integrates synaptic
    organization with dendritic tree-like morphology. The dendristor presents bioplausible
    nonlinear integration of excitatory/inhibitory synaptic inputs and silent synapses
    with diverse spatial distribution dependency, emulating direction selectivity,
    which is the feature to react to signal direction on the dendrite. Silent synapses
    turn to be crucial in dendritic computation, enhancing direction selectivity.
    Finally, we develop a neuromorphic dendritic neural circuit which we adopt as
    a building-block to design a multi-layer network system that emulates 3D spatial
    motion perception in the retina. The proposed dendritic computation demonstrates
    unique capabilities compared to the current paradigms in electronic device engineering
    for neuromorphic computation, providing solutions to explore new frontiers in
    network-based artificial intelligence, neurocomputation and brain-inspired computing.

  Talk title: The Virtual Brain reveals sweet dynamics of deep brain stimulation in
    Parkinson’s disease
  Abstract: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a successful symptom-relieving treatment
    for Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, the introduction of advanced directional
    DBS electrodes significantly expands the programming parameter space, rendering
    the traditional trial-and-error approach for DBS optimization impractical and
    demonstrating the need for computational tools. Our recently developed DBS model
    using The Virtual Brain simulation tool, i.e. whole-brain simulations based on
    dynamic neural mass models coupled via the connectome, was able to reproduce multiple
    biologically plausible effects of DBS in PD (Meier et al., 2022). In the current
    work, we extend our virtual DBS model towards higher resolution for the stimulus
    input, now sensitive to the exact 3D location of the activated contact, incorporating
    streamline activations and the electric field.We simulate DBS of N=14 PD patients
    with available empirical data on contact activations of N=392 different electrode
    settings with corresponding motor task outcome. A linear model based on the principal
    component involvement of the simulated network dynamics demonstrated a correlation
    between predicted and empirically observed motor task improvements due to DBS
    of r=0.386 (p<10-4) in a leave-one-out cross-validation. Benchmarking revealed
    a trend towards better predictions with our “sweet dynamics” than imaging-based
    static models such as the sweet spot (r=0.16, p<0.05) and sweet streamline (r=0.26,
    p<10-4) models (Hollunder et al., 2024). Furthermore, our model outperforms the
    traditional trial-and-error method in predicting optimal clinical settings for
    individual patients, e.g. achieving over a 60% likelihood of identifying the optimal
    contact within the first two suggested contacts.In the future, the identified
    sweet dynamics can be used to optimize the electrode placement and settings in
    silico in individual patients, showcasing the potential benefit of network-based
    simulations for improving clinical routine.
