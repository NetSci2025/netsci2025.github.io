Emergency and Health
--------------------
In emergency situations, you can contact the local police, ambulance service, fire department and other emergency services by calling 112.

Medical Services:
Should you need to see a doctor or a dentist, we recommend contacting your hotel’s reception desk who will direct you to the medical professionals assigned to the hotel. If immediate medical attention is required, call the emergency services at 112. Emergency medical services (including transportation by ambulance) are not free and you will be billed for any services rendered.

Health and Immunizations:
Vaccination certificates are usually not needed when travelling to the Netherlands, but please check with your local embassy as requirements may change.
There are no specific health risks associated with travel to The Netherlands. Ensure coverage by your own health insurance and bring necessary documents on the trip. If you're a European citizen from within EU/EEA, a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) gives you access to medically necessary, state-provided healthcare during a temporary stay in The Netherlands.

Electricity
-----------
The standard electrical voltage in the Netherlands is 230 volts AC, 50Hz (hotel bathrooms may also have outlets for 100 volts). The electrical outlets in the Netherlands take two-pronged, round-pin plugs. We recommend that you purchase an adaptor for your electrical equipment prior to your arrival.

Water
-----
Tap water is safe to drink in Maastricht.

Temperature
-----------
Temperature is given in degrees Celsius.
Celsius to Fahrenheit: multiply Celsius by 1.8 and add 32 to convert to Fahrenheit.

Weather
-------
Average Temperature for June: 13 - 22 Celsius. Even though it is summer we recommend bringing some wet-weather gear for the occasional rain shower.

Distance
--------
Distances in the Netherlands are given in kilometers.
1 mile = 1.62 kilometers

Currency
--------
The monetary unit is the Euro (EUR). Bank notes are printed in values of €5, €10, €20, €50, €100, €200 and €500; and coins in values of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 cent, and €1 and €2. If changing currency, it is recommended to request smaller value notes of €5- €20 as it can be difficult to find establishments to take larger notes. It is advised against taking larger notes as problems regarding counterfeiting mean they are rarely accepted.

Major credit and debit cards (some restrictions apply to American Express and Diners) are accepted in shops, restaurants and hotels, but in some they are not, be sure to check before ordering. Cash is withdrawn with your Visa, MasterCard, Maestro or Cirrus card at any ATM. Taxis may not accept card payments, so it is essential to have some local currency.

If your country of residence is outside of The Netherlands, you may qualify for a sales-tax refund for purchases. You need to request a form for your refund at the shop when making your purchase.

ATMs & Credit Cards
-------------------
ATMs ("Geldmaat" in Dutch) are available throughout Maastricht, however, in the central area they are not open 24 hours a day, with some closing after 10pm. You can check the specific operating times on Google maps. Souvenir and clothing stores generally accept major credit cards, but many grocery stores, cafes, and smaller restaurants may only accept debit cards or cash.

Tipping
-------
At restaurants it is possible that you will be charged a cover charge of between 1-3 euros per head and most people choose to round up to the nearest Euro after this, but you can leave more for excellent service. Some restaurants also charge an additional service charge on the bill which can be around 10% in which case you do not need to leave anything additional. These charges should be written on the menu or made clear before ordering. Tipping cab drivers is unusual but appreciated if they have assisted with luggage. Most people prefer to round up to the closest Euro to avoid handling small change.
