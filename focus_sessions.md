# Focus Sessions 

Focus Sessions at NetSci are thematic mini-symposia that bring together researchers working on specific topics within network science. They offer a platform for focused presentations, discussion, and collaboration around emerging or specialized areas.


The school will take place on Friday June 6th between 14:00-16:00. For more information, please check the [Program](https://netsci2025.github.io/program_at_a_glance/)



## Focus Session 1: Network Psychometrics

Join us for a focus session introducing network psychometrics to the NetSci community. Network psychometrics applies network science to psychological assessment, modeling psychological attributes as interconnected systems rather than isolated variables. While this approach has become well-established within psychology and has changed the way researchers understand mental health, personality, and cognitive processes, there has been surprisingly little interaction between network psychometricians and the broader network science community. This session aims to bridge that gap, showcasing how psychological networks differ from and complement other network applications in physics, biology, and social sciences. We invite NetSci researchers to discover this rich application domain where their expertise could drive new theoretical and methodological advances, while exposing the unique challenges and innovations that network psychometrics brings to complex systems research.

      <p class="title">The network approach to understanding and treating psychopathology. Chasing rainbows or finding gold?</p>
      <p class="subtitle"></p>
      <div class="red-line"></div>
      <p class="description">
        Anne’s research focuses mainly on the neuroscience and psychology of overweight, obesity and eating disorders. Funded by an NWO-VIDI grant, she examined how dietary restraint, bodyweight, and mindset influence neural representations of food, using fMRI. In 2023, she started a new project, funded by an NWO-VICI grant, focused on personalized understanding and treatment of overweight and obesity (www.theendofaverage.nl). The network approach to psychopathology features centrally in her recent research as well, and she is a co-PI in the Gravitation Project New Science of Mental Disorders (www.nsmd.eu). Life is not only work, and she loves a healthy lifestyle. As often as time allows, she is playing tennis or padel, or goes for a run, and recently started teaching kids the fundamentals of tennis.

      <p class="title">Measuring psychological constructs in the network framework</p>
      <p class="subtitle"></p>
      <div class="red-line"></div>
      <p class="description">
        I research the contrast between traditional latent variable frameworks (where attributes cause shared variance among observed variables) and network perspectives (where direct causal relations between observed variables form clusters representing psychological attributes). My work combines empirical comparisons of these models with philosophical exploration of statistical interpretation, questioning how we conceptualize common factors, random variables, and what constitutes "observed" variables in psychological measurement.

      <p class="subtitle">leveraging psychometric networks and symptom dynamics in the assessment and treatment of mental disorders</p>
      <div class="red-line"></div>
      <p class="description">
        Omid V. Ebrahimi is a Senior Researcher at the University of Oxford. His research focuses on the mechanisms underlying the development and maintenance of common mental health disorders (i.e. depression and anxiety) using multi-level and systems-based approaches, including models from network psychometrics and the dynamical systems field. In particular, this research examines how critical incidents occurring at the national and global level (e.g., infectious disease outbreaks, climate change, and economic recession) impact the development of common mental disorders and can alter human behaviour.
